# OpenComputers for Minecraft 1.16+

This repository is a port of OpenComputers from 1.12 that aims to retain as much of the original code and structure as possible.

## Build Instructions:

This project can be set up and built using the instructions provided by the MDK.

1. First, clone the repository using
```
git clone https://github.com/SirDavidLudwig/OpenComputers1.16
```

2. Next, open the project in either IntelliJ or Eclipse. I'm working with IntelliJ in my dev environment, so you may have to figure some things out for Eclipse if that's what you prefer.

3. Execute the `genIntelliJRuns` gradle task (`genEclipseRuns` in Eclipse of course).

4. The mod can now be built and ran in your IDE using the various `runClient`/`runServer`/`runData` tasks!
